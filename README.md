<p>Project Title: RESTful API using Node.js</p>
 <p>
  This project showcases my ability to build a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and
  MongoDB to manage U.S. state data. I structured the application using the
  Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns and
  maintainable code. The server handles full CRUD operations via GET, POST, PATCH, and
  DELETE requests, with routes defined in Express and validated through custom
  middleware.
</p>
<p>
  I used Mongoose to define and enforce a schema for MongoDB, enabling structured
  storage of state-specific fun facts. The API merges static JSON data with dynamic
  database content using a custom function, allowing enriched responses while
  preserving original metadata. I tested all endpoints locally using Postman to verify
  proper JSON responses and error handling.
